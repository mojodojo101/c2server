# c2server
## A simple command and control server written in golang
---
## The core is working now, together with the angular client
## and the ![testbeacon.go](https://github.com/mojodojo101/c2server/tree/master/internal_resources/beacons) you should be able to get a demo going on a local server 
## the token is just a stub and this will change later on
## same with the entire authentication at the moment

TODO:
* Add better authentication for client and active beacon
* Add Beacon Templates
* Add better Server-Beacon Communication
* Add better Client-Server Communication
